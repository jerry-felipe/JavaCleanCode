# Java Famous Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations of some of the most famous and widely-used algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is designed to demonstrate efficiency, clarity, and practical application, complete with examples and explanations.

# Algorithms Included

# Sorting Algorithms
- QuickSort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts data by partitioning.
- MergeSort: A stable, recursive sorting algorithm ideal for large datasets.
- BubbleSort: A simple sorting algorithm for small datasets.

# Searching Algorithms
- Binary Search: Fast searching in sorted arrays with O(log n) complexity.
- Linear Search: A straightforward search method for unsorted datasets.

# Graph Traversal Algorithms
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving deeper.

# Features
- ðŸ›  Well-documented code: Clear comments and step-by-step explanations.
- ðŸš€ Optimized implementations: Focused on performance and readability.
- ðŸ“š Usage examples: Real-world scenarios and test cases for each algorithm.

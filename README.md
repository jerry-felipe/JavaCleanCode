# Multi-language Clean Code Practices Project  

This repository demonstrates best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code across three languages: Java, C#, and Python. It includes examples, design patterns, and refactoring techniques to enhance code quality and promote team collaboration.

# Features
- üõ† Multi-language support: Code examples in Java, C#, and Python.
- üßπ Clean code principles: Focus on readability, simplicity, and maintainability.
- üèó Design patterns: Real-world implementations of common patterns.
- üîÑ Refactoring techniques: Step-by-step transformations of messy code into clean code.
- üìö Best practices: Guidelines for naming, structuring, and testing your code.

# Technologies Used
- Java: Examples built using Java 17.
- C#: Implementations in .NET Core 6.
- Python: Scripts and modules designed for Python 3.9+.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
- Install the following tools:
  - Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher)
  - .NET SDK (6.0 or higher)
  - Python 3.9 or higher
- Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/clean-code-practices.git
   cd clean-code-practices
   '''
2. Navigate to the folder of your preferred language ('/java', '/csharp', '/python').

3. Follow the specific setup instructions:
   - Java:  
     '''bash
     cd java
     ./gradlew build
     '''
   - C#:  
     '''bash
     cd csharp
     dotnet build
     '''
   - Python:  
     '''bash
     cd python
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     '''

# Usage
- Browse the examples for each language:
  - Java: 'src/main/java'
  - C#: 'src/'
  - Python: 'src/'

- Run the examples to see clean code in action:
  - Java:  
    '''bash
    ./gradlew run
    '''
  - C#:  
    '''bash
    dotnet run
    '''
  - Python:  
    '''bash
    python src/example.py
    '''
